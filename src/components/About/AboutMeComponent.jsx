                    <p>My name is andre vasquez, I found my passion for programming when i wrote my first macro i excel VBA.
                        the realization that i could create anythin i set my mind to really drove it home for me. 
                        After coding for a bit with VBA i decided i didnt want to be limited to just using excel to create, quickly scouring the internet
                        for languges i could learn. This lead me to finding the one language to rule them all "Python".
                        After 6 months of python

                    </p>

            </Row>
        </Container>
