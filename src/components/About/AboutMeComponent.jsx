                        <p>My name is andre vasquez, I found my passion for programming when i wrote my first macro in excel VBA.
                            the realization that i could create anything i set my mind to really drove it home for me. 
                            After coding for a bit with VBA i decided i didnt want to be limited to just using excel to create, quickly scouring the internet
                            for languages i could learn. This lead me to finding the one language to rule them all "Python".
                            After 6 months of learning python, i decided to round out my learning. Enrolling into "Nucamp Bootcamp" and diving into
                            front end development using HTML,CSS,Javascript and finally React.<br/>

                            In a personal persepective, im an avid traveler and food lover. I've been fortunate enough to visit over 20+ states and 3 countries!
                            Tasting delicious native plates along the way. My ultimate goal in life is to visit at least 15 countries and every world wonder, 1/8 to go.
                            When im not nose deep in books and coding, i like to play,watch and talk basketballüèÄ and play online games with my favorite being Battlefield 5.
