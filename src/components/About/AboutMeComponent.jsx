                        <p>My name is andre Vasquez, I found my passion for programming when I wrote my first macro in excel VBA. the realization that I could create anything I set my mind to drove it home for me. After coding for a bit with VBA I decided I didn't want to be limited to just using excel to create; quickly scouring the internet for languages I could learn. This leads me to find the one language to rule them all "Python". After 6 months of learning python, I decided to round out my learning. Enrolling into "Nucamp Bootcamp" and diving into front-end development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and finally, React.<br/>

                        From a personal perspective, I'm an avid traveler and food lover. I've been fortunate enough to visit over 20+ states and 3 countries! Tasting delicious native plates along the way. My ultimate goal in life is to visit at least 15 countries and every world wonder, 1/8 to go. When I'm not coding, I like to play/watch basketballüèÄ and play online games with my favorite being Civilization 6.

                        I'm also a dog person! I care for 2 puppies; a 6-month-old bratty Alaskan Klee kai named Mishka üê∫, and a cuddly 3-month-old Miniature Australian shepherd named Potato ü•î.
